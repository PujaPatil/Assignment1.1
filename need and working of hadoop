Hadoop is needed to overcome the challenges of big data that are-
storage 
processing

hadoop is needed to manage the above mentioned challenges as hadoop distributed file system manages the storage and 
map reduce manages the processing.

Working of hadoop
With hdfs the data is written once on the server and subsequently read and re-used many times.
And MapReduce mainly works as breaking down the data into smaller manageable pieces and then processing the data in parallel
on the distributed cluster and then combine the result.
